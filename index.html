<p>My name is Raquel Vega Gonzalez and I was born on January 28, 2002 in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  My beloved island is currently in a crisis due to the aftermath of hurricane Maria which left the whole island without power and it's been 38 days now since the hurricane hit and about 95% of people still don't have power. Roads have been destroyed, families have been separated, lives have been lost. The US government must do something valuable, and fast because there are still communities who haven't been reached and people have died because of that. On another note, crime is worse than it's ever been.  Since there are limited resources and limited amounts of food then people have been stealing and fighting for food, gas, generators, water, etc. Even surgeries have had to be performed in the dark, and have had to depend only on the flashlights on people's phones. I currently feel very helpless, my family and I have donated money but I just wish I could travel down there and do hands on work. I have many friends who have had to move to Florida and leave their families behind in order to live better lives. An act of kindness that impressed me the most was that Brown University offered free tuition for 50 students of the University of Puerto Rico so that they could continue their studies there. Also, many celebrities have come together to raise money for Puerto Rico. For instance, Jennifer Lopez along with Marc Anthony (fellow Puerto Rican), and Alex Rodriguez were able to raise over 30 million dollars. I appreciate everything that people have done to help my beautiful island.  But sadly, we still need more. Lots of people have lost their homes and all their pesonal belongings. I know that even though we are going through a tough time, Puerto Ricans always mantain a positive spirit and that's something that I will always be proud of. It gives me great pleasure to say that I am Puerto Rican and there's nothing better than that. It feels like so long since I've been there but it's only been three months. I originally moved in December 2016 but it feels like much longer. When I went back to visit over the summer, I realized how much I had missed it and it's people. Puerto Ricans can't be compared to other races/ethnicities because we are simply one of a kind. Puerto Ricans are the loudest, the funniest, and the best people I've ever known. I hope I can someday live back there, I wish my children could be raised in Puerto Rico but that wasn't ideal before due to the financial crisis and it's even less ideal now due to the aftermath of the hurricane. Right now the closest thing to home is Florida because in less than a month 55,000 Puerto Ricans arrived there and not to mention all the Puerto Ricans there were before the hurricane. When I finish my bachelor's degree I want to move/study in a school of medicine in Florida so when I graduate from med school then I would go on to work and eventually live and raise my children in Florida. Hopefully, my family can move there with me when the time comes. My uncle will be moving to Orlando in less than two weeks so maybe he'll be the one to motivate the rest of the family to move there too. I miss the days when I was surrounded by Puerto Ricans everywhere I went. Even the Spanish accent that we have is unique. No other Spanish speaking country has the accent that we Puerto Ricans have. I would never see myself getting married to an American, I mean nothing against Americans but I could never spend the rest of my life with someone other than a Puerto Rican. Finally, there's not a day that goes by that I don't think about my uncomparable island. I hope that I will be able to visit again in the near future. You know what they say, home is where the heart is and that couldn't be more right.</p>
